# The UI should have a big red record button stating we will record for 5 seconds.
# When clicked, let's show a spinner stating we are processing the audio.
# If we click the button, we should record for 5 seconds and then transcribe the audio to text,
# send it to chatGPT and then speak the text asynchronously - all using the audio.py module and methods inside this project
